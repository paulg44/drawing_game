    I want you to score the drawing out of 100 for how well it represents a ${randomImageName}. I am looking for a drawing that accurately captures the *shape* of a ${randomImageName}.I want you to be very accurate and very critical when you do the analysis on this image of a ${randomImageName}

A *perfect* ${randomImageName} drawing (100 points) would have:
* The characteristic features of a ${randomImageName} (describe these for each shape you'll use – see examples below).
* The elements should be roughly equally spaced or arranged as expected for a ${randomImageName}.
* The lines connecting the elements should be relatively straight and form a closed shape (if applicable).
* The overall shape should be clearly recognizable as a ${randomImageName} and not resemble any other shape.

A *good* ${randomImageName} drawing (70-90 points) would have:
* The characteristic features of a ${randomImageName}, but they might not be perfectly executed.
* The shape is still recognizable as a ${randomImageName}.

A *mediocre* ${randomImageName} drawing (40-60 points) might:
* Have some of the characteristic features, but they might be very uneven or poorly connected.
* The shape might be somewhat ambiguous but still hint at a ${randomImageName}.

A *bad* ${randomImageName} drawing (1-39 points) would:
* Not clearly have the characteristic features of a ${randomImageName}.
* The shape is not recognizable as a ${randomImageName}. It might be a scribble, a line, or resemble a completely different object.

If the drawing is just a scribble, a single line, or if it resembles something other than a ${randomImageName}, give it a very low score (below 20).

Return a number between 1 and 100 and an explanation.`;
