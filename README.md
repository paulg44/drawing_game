# drawing_game

## OVERVIEW ##
Since I started paying around with unity, I asked my kids of a game idea and my 4 year old daughter I think has actually come up with a good idea.
It's basic concept is an image appears and, in Ivy's words, you have 5 seconds to draw(copy) it. Now, 5 seconds may be a little quick. So it got me thinking, has this game been done? It must have right? Turns out possibly not, well not that I've found. The closest style game would be Google's Quick Draw where an AI trys to guess what you are drawing. Having thought even more this could actually be a fun learning game for children to learn shapes etc and more difficult fun game for adults.

## TECH ##
I think this would be a good web based game. I have started playing around with Unity, but Eli's game will be better for that. With HTML's canvas element it "should" be fairly simple to create the basic game and layout. I can also fetch random images with certain filters from unsplash for example. Lastly I will use some sort of AI to compare the given image and the users drawn image and try and parse some kind of "score".

~~ All subject to change if a framework or tool is better ~~
- Frontend - React => A tech I am familar with and i think the compartmentalised components will work well with this project.
- Backend - NodeJS and Express => Again it's what I'm familar with.
- AI - Currently looking at structural similarity index measure (SSIM) as I believe this will be the easiest way to get the project up and running quickly.

## WHAT WILL I LEARN ##
Firstly the canvas element, how to draw with the mouse and add different colours, sizes of "pen" etc. Secondly some kind of AI comparison tool, this is to be determined exactly what I will use, but whatever it will be it will be new to me. Then there's the possibiltiy of making this a mobile/tablet game. Having watched my children play game's on their tablets I think this could be a good mobile style game.
